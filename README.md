# ui-challange
UI code challenge.

## The task
The challenge is to achieve a responsive design as per the screens present in the assets directory. The screens are provided for 3 different resolutions. There is no need for implementing the undelying functionality.

This is a helper repo to get you started with.
Prerequisite
[Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/). 
Steps:
```
git+https://github.com/mcmakler/ui-challange.git
cd ui-challenge
yarn
yarn serve
```
This repo uses [parceljs](https://parceljs.org/) and contains support for [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- You are free to use any framework/pre-processor.
- Use icons/assets wherever required.

## Issues
Design UI , has no style guide making it difficult to achieve pixel perfection
- Font Size , difficult to pick accurate font size, color and weighting from the design due to the doc file format
- Icon's images could be improved as well :) 
- I tried to replicate the design as best as possible
- Sketch file or PSD would be nice , to achieve pixel perfection


## Improvement
I understand my code needs some improvement but based on time schedule i used the best approach as possible to achieve presentable results.

#Needs to be improved
- Variables for my Color Codes
- Responsive Framework [bootstrap, etc]
- Responsive Files && Imagery etc

#PS

```
For font tips, imagery & basic color, i tried to copy some design guidelines from the website https://www.mcmakler.de/ as to be consistent as much as possible

Feel free to let me know , if you have any questions.
